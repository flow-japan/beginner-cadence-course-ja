# Chapter 6 Day 3 - Now What?

Well... that's it folks. You did the course AND the extra credit. Sheesh, why are you such a tryhard?

## Now What?

Now that you're done, you may be wondering "What the heck do I do now?"

### Create Your Own Contract

My suggestion is to find a partner (it's also okay to work by yourself) and create a smart contract together. But this time, don't do NFTs. Make something else. Something cooler.

Here are some suggestions:

1. A voting contract
2. A fungible token contract
3. A Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) contract 
4. Be creative!

### Take our DApp Course!

Now that you have tons of Cadence knowledge, you might want to start applying it to real-world applications. How does <a href="https://nbatopshot.com/">NBATopShot</a> run? How does <a href="https://floats.city/">FLOAT</a> actually work?

Behind the scenes, it's a lot of contracts. But there's more to it...
- Frontend development
- Backend development
- Styling
- Deploying a DApp
- and more more...

The good news is, we have a <a href="https://github.com/emerald-dao/beginner-dapp-course">Beginner DApp Course</a>, just like this one, to help you make your own DApp. You have wayyyyyyy more Cadence knowledge than you need for our DApp course. In fact, you can completely skip Chapter 1 and Chapter 3 Days 1-2. 

### Stick Around

Stick around in the broader Emerald City DAO and find/ask for projects you want to work on! There are always tons of areas to contribute on with proper Cadence knowledge.

Even if you have a random idea for Emerald City, and you want to build it, we would be more than happy to support you.

### Goodbye

I don't like goodbyes so... goodbye! I'll miss u <3
